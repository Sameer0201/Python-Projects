## Encryption

### RSA encryption

RSA encryption is an algorithm which can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. This script can take an input script and encrypt with using prime numbers and provide the user with a public and private keypair to decrypt the message.

### Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher is a simple form of encryption where each alphabet, n, is shifted to the n-1 alphabet in the english language. I further try to improve this algorithm by making it more complex.

## Data Visualization for MRI scans

In this project, I play around with Matlab plots to view 3D Volumetric Data from an MRI data set.
